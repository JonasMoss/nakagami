## Overview
An `R`-package for the [Nakagami distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakagami_distribution).

## Installation
Use the following command from inside `R`:
```{r install, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("JonasMoss/nakagami")
```

## Usage

The density function is `dnaka`, the probability distribution is `pnaka`, 
the quantile function is `qnaka` and random deviate generator is `rnaka`. Use
them just like the `*gamma` functions in the `stats` package.

```{r}
set.seed(313)
x = seq(0, 3, by = 0.01)
hist(nakagami::rnaka(10^5, shape = 4, scale = 2), freq = FALSE, breaks = "FD")
lines(x, nakagami::dnaka(x, shape = 4, scale = 2), type = "l", lwd = 2)

```

## Note

All of these functions are implemented in the `R` package [`VGAM`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=VGAM). As of `VGAM` version 1.1-2, 
the implementations in `nakagami` are faster, more thoroughly tested, and use 
a standardized set of arguments following the template of `dgamma` et cetera.

The `rnaka` of `nakagami` is much faster than the `rnaka` of `VGAM`:
```{r rnaka}
#install.packages("VGAM")

microbenchmark::microbenchmark(nakagami::rnaka(100, 2, 4), 
                               VGAM::rnaka(100, 4, 2))


```

And the quantile function of `nakagami` is slightly faster.
```{r qnaka}
p = 1:10/11
microbenchmark::microbenchmark(nakagami::qnaka(0.01, 10, 4), 
                               VGAM::qnaka(0.01, 4, 10))
```

Moreover, `VGAM::qnaka` fails to implement the standard argument `log.p` and
`VGAM::rnaka` uses the non-standard arguments `Smallno` and `...`.
